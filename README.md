## movie actor comparison is the idea we are going with. atm
 
    inspired from IMDB
    rotten tomatoes API
 
    input name or click on, pops out criteria area for you to select from 
    then compare tags and narrows to the ones with the same tag




###Price comparsion tool for shopping. Food clothes etc compares all items

    where would we get the data
    may need google map API
    supermarket api https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/13/aislefinder-launches-supermarket-api-an-open-source-api-for-groceries/

    issue now is if referenced or named differnetly how do you sort through that have to get createive and use maybe the address instead of the name of the product. if both products had the UPC then that should be the same between the two


### zillow
    local travel ez to save location, then tell me where it is (like pin on map or tell how far it is from your location)
 
### Soundcloud
    house party app
    central location for all music
    streaming from phone to phone to share music that is only available form a apple product or special app
 
### Spotify
    need ideas on how to make spotify better


#### Travel Map with more functionality *out of scope*
    A google maps idea that pins the gas stations or food along the way along your trip within a certain radius of the road. Like you input how many miles to a tank you can go or what your mpgs are, to pin and route to  gas station or food once parameters are put in. Routes it all for you and to the station. (this inspired from my truck cause it gets 9mpg)
 
	Google maps api

### Music app that just streams music (sorta add on to the soundcloud and spotify)
    store where you got the song from aka like location song ID 
    could imbed all players into one location and then switches between all the players depending on teh song that is playing currently

### Suggested trips app
    when people suggest ideas of location to go it adds it to a favorites or something so you can come back to it later and view the trip
